# üìù NoteKeeper

NoteKeeper is a simple React Native app that demonstrates **global state management using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)**. It provides a clean and minimal example of how to use Zustand to manage shared state across multiple screens in a mobile application.
## üìå Project Overview

This project showcases:

- ‚úÖ Global state management using Zustand
- ‚úÖ Create and delete notes functionality
- ‚úÖ Conditional UI rendering based on app state
- ‚úÖ Navigation flow with stack reset to control back navigation

- üìÑ Create notes with title and description

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **src** directory.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
